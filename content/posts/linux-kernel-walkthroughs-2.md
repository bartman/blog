I will be running [another]{linux-kernel-walkthroughs} [Linux Kernel Walkthrough](http://oclug.on.ca/meeting/35/)
for [OCLUG](http://oclug.on.ca/) at [TheCodeFactory](http://thecodefactory.ca/) next week.  This time the topic is "booting".

I am frantically preparing slides using (slightly modified) Rusty's [svg to png](http://ozlabs.org/~rusty/index.cgi/2006)
presentation scripts.  The svg's are naturally created in Inkscape, and the png's are useful because I can display them in
a regular image viewer like gqview.  I'll write more on this later.
