I switched to Dave's perl version of my blog.  The old blog is still [available here](/~bart/blog-old/).

One of the cool additions from his [mercurial tree](http://www.dmo.ca/hg/hgwebdir.cgi/vimblog) was support for
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  Which makes generating html easier.

When I make changes to the source, I will publish my changes in [my mercurial tree](http://www.jukie.net/~bart/hg/hgwebdir.cgi/vimblog).

Thanks Dave!
