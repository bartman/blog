<p>

I sold my 3 month old Canon "Digital Rebel" 300D.  Upgraded to a Nikon 

D70...  and what a huge difference that was.  

</p>

<p>

I do find the pictures that are produced with the D70 sensor not as high

in detail under some conditions, however I must say that overall they are

at par.  The &quot;big difference&quot; comes in the rest of the camera.

</p>

<p>

The interface makes it far quicker to access control options and the

camera itself is faster to react -- no more missing shots because my

daughter wont sit still -- and I can just shoot freely without checking

if the memory buffer is full (my Rebel sometimes became unoperational 

when it was saving data to compact flash).

</p>

<p>

On the negative, the D70 has a small issue referred to as &quot;back

focusing&quot;, which I have seen a few times.  The camera has a hard time

deciding what to focus on if there is a large flat background behind a 

small subject.  Taking a second image with AF, or just using manual focusing, 

fixes the problem for me... I guess I will live until they fix it in firmware.
