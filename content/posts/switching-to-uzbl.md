I've been using [vimperator](http://vimperator.org/trac/wiki/Vimperator) for a long time now.  I love this firefox plugin, but firefox is pretty slow at times.



Today I decided to more seriously look at [uzbl](http://www.uzbl.org/).  I am surprised how much I like it.



I've put up my [configuration](http://github.com/bartman/dot-uzbl/tree/master) on github and will try to blog about it again as I convert more of my usage to uzbl.
