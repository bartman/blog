I have had an item on my todo list to improve my [vim/git]{tag/vimgit} integration for a while.  Today,

I found [git-vim](http://github.com/motemen/git-vim/tree/master) on github.  I was really

impressed.  So I forked it and hope to do some work on the project...



        git://git.jukie.net/git-vim.git



First I will have to check if there is anything salvageable from [my current vim scripts](http://www.vim.org/account/profile.php?user_id=1186).
