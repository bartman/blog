I committed a fix for an annoying bug in the urxvt [mark-yank-urls]{urxvt-url-yank} script.



This has been reported by several people.  I have *finally* 

[fixed it](http://gitweb.jukie.net/urxvt.git?a=commitdiff;h=9b5dc7b01fd993b55098d29e85a7bd41b9a66d2a;hp=d445476b6c0eca2472564c447400f28081b8799b), but the credit should go to Hans Dieter Pearcey, Daniel Danner

and Olof Johansson for reporting it.
