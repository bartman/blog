I just switched to the *Holiday Miracle Plan* from

[WindMobile.ca](http://windmobile.ca).  I thought I'd mention it since it's not

advertised, but a fantastic deal.  You have to sign up by December 26th, but you get

to keep this rate for as long as you are a customer.



In short: it's unlimited-everything for $40/month.  It's Wind, so there are no contracts, hidden fees, or strings attached.

* Unlimited Canada-wide calling

* Unlimited US Long Distance

* Unlimited Canada/US Text messaging

* Unlimited Canada/US MMS (picture messaging)
