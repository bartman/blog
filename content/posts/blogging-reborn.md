## again

This seems to happen often.  I go through a consistent burst of blogging, then I get
distracted by work, and stop.

Well here is another attempt at blogging.  This time with hugo.

<!--more-->

So far I followed the [quickstart](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
and picked this fancy [terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) theme.

I'm here because I've been converting my dev system to NixOS, and I'm learning a lot
of new things.  Might as well put them to paper.
