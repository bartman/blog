I am giving [another]{into-to-git-talk-2} git talk for [The Ottawa Group of Ruby Enthusiasts!](http://groups.google.ca/group/ogre-list/browse_thread/thread/19e76fec11053b92).



The talk is on July 9th at 7:00 PM, at [Infonium](http://infonium.ca/).

I was told that they have room for 20 people.



I will post my slides after the talk.
