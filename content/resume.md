## Formulus Black
- Senior Software Architect
- Dec 2019 – Jul 2021

Providing research, development, and optimization services for Formulus Black,
a venture backed startup enabling next-generation persistent in-memory
computing, without peripherals or application changes. Using Linux kernel,
PMEM/DCPMM, storage drivers, ramdisk, SPDK/DPDK, userspace drivers, AVX-512,
lockless algorithms.

## Diablo Technologies Inc
- Chief Software Architect
- November 2010-August 2017

Involved in 3 main projects:

"MegaDIMM" project: Initially designed and implemented a software simulation
environment. Developed as a block device driver in C on Linux. Implementation
ran cycle-exact simulation of hardware Diablo would later build in FPGA.
Coordinated FPGA board bringup, porting simulator to driver, assisted in FPGA
design, and firmware debug.

"TeraDIMM" project: Heavily involved in designing a software stack to support
Diablo's Memory1 hardware architecture. Implemented driver on Linux, and helped
to port it to Windows and VMware ESX. Heavily relied on Linux tool chain,
oprofile, Linux perf, and in house tools for gathering performance numbers.
Concentrated on performance characterization and code optimization.

"DMX" project: Prototyped, designed, and developed initial prototype of Diablo
Memory eXpansion software stack. Initially implemented as a modification to
Linux kernel, and later ported to be a loadable module. Operational on host,
KVM and containers. Implemented custom page fault handler using private PTE
page-table tree. Worked with the software team to productise it. Designed
initial smart prefetching algorithms that would keep ahead of the application
paging in data the application would require. Added support for DMX to use NVME
devices. Heavily relied on Linux tool chain, Linux perf, Linux crash tool, and
in house tools for benchmarking DMX. Concentrated on improving performance of
the design, and removing multi-threading bottlenecks.

## FortiNet
- Software Developer
- March 2004-June 2004

Worked on debugging and extending the functionality of the FortiLog product,
which was designed to collect events from other FortiNet units and generate
reports; scope extended to developing software to handle various RAID
configurations, detecting and acting on faults, and helping integrate code into
several existing products.

## SOMA Networks
- Software Developer
- September 2001-March 2004

Designed, implemented, and responsible for a set of drivers handling telecom
radio communication and configuration, via PCI bus using async DMA; the target
platforms of said drivers were arm-linux and x86-linux.

## Chrysalis-ITS
- Software Developer
- January 2000-August 2001

Designed, implemented, and responsible for maintenance of a cross platform
(Linux/FreeBSD) driver and debug tools for a PCI device; helped in porting it
to WinNT and Solaris; designed and implemented an automated testing environment
for the PCI device; involved in porting a kernel IPSec implementation to use a
hardware accelerator; wrote various kernel modules to exercise the
Chrysalis-ITS hardware; also, worked on various internal tools used by the
firmware developers; provided Linux tutelage to other project developers; as a
background task maintained a project CVS/NFS server for various developers.

## International Datacasting Corporation
- Software Specialist
- May 1998-January 2000

Developed and maintained a Java based status & control application; researched
the needed tools and support software, in part designed, and developed the
majority of the firmware to drive the next generation Superflex product;
firmware was written in C++, taking advantage of POSIX threads, and ran on
Linux; reduced a Linux install to fit on an 8M flash disk; extensively involved
in design of the firmware and control protocol specification for the new data
satellite receiver; solely responsible for research of technologies and
development of the firmware.
