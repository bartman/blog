MadCoder wrote today about [git-rebase --interactive](http://blog.madism.org/index.php/2007/09/09/138-git-awsome-ness-git-rebase-interactive-?cos=1)
which is a new feature in git that allows you to easily reorder, or fix patches already applied to the 
current branch by editing a file... very neat.
