<p>I've been taking digital images for over a year (maybe), but using Gimp for
many years for just about any image manipulation.  It's a fantastic program...
possibly the best piece of (desktop) software on Linux.

<p>Anyway the point of this entry was to point you to this page:<br>
<a href=http://www.linuxartist.org/>LinuxArtist's</a>
<a href=http://www.linuxartist.org/2d.php>2d application list</a><br>
which has a list of several other nice image related software packages.
