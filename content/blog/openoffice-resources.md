<p>
Today I wasted 2 hours at work trying to figure out how to convert a word 
document to OpenOffice and preserve the numbering in the document sections.  
Actually, the corporate template I was using had the first 3 section styles 
defined with numbering (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc), but the 4th heading did
not have a number preceding it.  OOo and I had words, in the end I gave up.

Tonight I ran into this page:
<ul>
<li><a href=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/hillview/OOo/>Iannz OpenOffice.org page</a>
</ul>
which seems to be a real life saver.
