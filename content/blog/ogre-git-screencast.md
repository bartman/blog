[Ian Ward](http://excess.org) posted a [screencast](http://excess.org/article/2008/07/ogre-git-tutorial/) of my 
[Git intro talk](http://www.jukie.net/~bart/blog/ogre-git-intro).  Thanks [Richard](tricolour.net/) for doing
the audio, Ian for doing the screencast and post production, and [Jay](http://infonium.ca/) for hosting us.

*Update:* Richard took [some photos of the OGRE meeting](http://tricolour.net/photos/2008/07/09/oclug.html).  Thanks.
