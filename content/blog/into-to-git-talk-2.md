I recently gave my [git talk]{20070329011735} for a client.  I had about 3.5 hours,
and found that was quite adequate to relay all the information.  My 
[slides](/~bart/slides) are available in 
[PDF](/~bart/slides/intro-to-git/intro-to-git.pdf) and the 
[magicpoint source](/~bart/slides/intro-to-git/intro-to-git.tgz).
